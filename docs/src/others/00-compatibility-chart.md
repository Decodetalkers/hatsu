# Compatibility Chart

Hatsu is primarily geared towards the micro-blogging platform in the Fediverse.

Currently I've created a chart for all the platforms I expect to be compatible with, and hopefully it will be filled in later:

## Send

|            | [Note] | [Accept] |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| Mastodon   | ✅     | ✅       |
| GoToSocial |        |          |
| Misskey    |        |          |
| Pleroma    |        |          |

## Receive

|            | [Follow] |     |
| ---------- | -------- | --- |
| Mastodon   | ✅       |     |

| Misskey    |          |     |
| Pleroma    |          |     |

<!-- After a period of time: if you wish to support the new platform, you can open a new discussion. -->
